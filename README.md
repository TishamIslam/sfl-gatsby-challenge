## Description
### Introduction
My name is Tisham Islam and this project was made as a pre-onboarding project for Software For Love, a Google-certified charity that develops software as a means of giving back to the community. 

### Details
This project was made using the Gatsby default starter template. The objective was to add a header to navigate through the 3 included pages.
I added Tailwind CSS myself since I really like it and thought it'd be useful to be able to learn how to add it to a new project (the projects I've worked on using Tailwind had it already included).
